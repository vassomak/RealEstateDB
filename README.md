# RealEstateDB
This is a group assignment of the course Databases (AUTh - 9th semester).

The purpose is to develop a relational database. Data demands, user categories and privileges are reported. Some typical views and queries (in both relational algebra and SQL language) are defined in order to highlight the functionality of the database.
