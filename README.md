# RealEstateDB
This is a group assignment of the course Databases (AUTh - 9th semester).

The purpose is to develop a relational database. My team and I decided to develop a database that meets the requirements of a Real Estate Agency. Data demands, user categories and privileges are reported. Some typical queries (in both relational algebra and SQL language) are defined in order to highlight the functionality of the database.

## realestatedb.mwb
This file contains the database model in MySQL Workbench format

## db-realestate15dump.sql
SQL script that creates the database model (tables, triggers, views).

## users.sql
SQL script that creates the users of the database and their rights.

## queries
Folder that contains implemented examples.
